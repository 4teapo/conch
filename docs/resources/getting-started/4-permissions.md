# Permissions

Setting up permissions and roles in Conch is really simple. In Conch, each role and permission is just a string. Users are given roles, and roles have a list of permissions that they are granted. In order to set the permissions a role grants, you can use `conch.set_role_permissions` when the server starts.

```luau
conch.set_role_permissions("vip",
	"use-capes",
	"use-server-command"
)
```

Roles can then be granted to a user through the `user.give_roles` function. You'll first need to obtain the user with `user.get_user`.

```luau
local player = Players.alicesays_hallo
local user = conch.get_user(player)
conch.give_roles(user, "vip")
```

This will now give alicesays_hallo the `vip` role, which gives them the permissions to `use-capes` and `use-server-commands`.

It's important to register permissions for each command, as not doing so allows anyone to run that command, even if they just joined.

## Super User

Conch has a special case for the `super-user`, which is a special role that should only be granted to only those you can trust. This role gives the user access to every permission that the developer has registered. When adding a command that allows users to give roles, please explicitly check that this role cannot be given.
