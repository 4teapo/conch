# Syntax

## Commands

Commands start on a new line with an identifier or variable (index). This will be called.

```
command1
$command1
$table.value
```

Providing identifiers to a command will call the command with the given arguments. Identifiers automatically get coerced into strings.

```
print value1 value2 value3
```

## Variables

A variable is the result of a command or expression. You can define variables by suffixing an identifier with the `=` sign. When the next token after the `=` sign is an identifier, it's considered a command and will be called. Otherwise, it's considered an expression.

```
variable = command1
```

## String Literals

You can create string literals by surrounding a string with `""`. You can pass string literals to commands and variables. Using a string literal lets you pass strings that cannot be parsed as an identifier

```
print "Hello World!"
variable = "Hello World!"
```

## Number Literals

Numbers consist of a sequence of digits and optionally a period inbetween. You are allowed to use underscores and `e` in your numbers.

```
give-money 100_000
give-money 1e6
n = 1e6
```

You can write hexadecimal or binary numbers by prefixing it with `0x` or `0b`.

```
set-flags 0b1111_1111
set-hexadecimal-value 0xFFFFFF
```

## Table Literals

You can define tables similar to luau inside Conch. They respect all luau semantics. Identifiers are automatically coerced into strings.

```
array = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
dictionary = { value = 1234, ["test"] = 1234, [meow] = true }
mixed = { value = 1234, 1, 2, 3, 4 }
```

## Vector Literals

Vectors can be defined by surrounding 3 values with `[]`.

```
vector = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Nested Commands

Conch doesn't allow executing commands when defining tables or vector literals. You can get around this by wrapping your command with $().

```
value = { [$( command1 "meow" )] = true }
```

## Booleans

`true` and `false` are keywords, and when used convert to a boolean.

```
value = true
```

## Function Literals

Functions can be defined by surrounding a list of arguments with `||` and then providing a body with `{}`.

```
meow = || {
	print "meow!"
}

foo = |argument| {
	print $argument
}
```

You can then evaluate these functions manually in your code.

```
$meow
$foo
```

## Control Flow

Conch provides basic control flow statements to allow for writing more complex commands. By default, conch comes with `if`, `while` and `for`. Conch also provides `break` and `continue` statements. These are currently experimental features.

```
if (false) {

} else {

}

if (command1 true) {

} else if (command2 true) {

}
```

```
while (true) {
	break
}
```

```
for ($table) | key, value | {
	print $key $value
}

for (command1) |key, value| {
	print $key $value
}
```
